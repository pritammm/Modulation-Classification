## Modulation Classification Using MATLAB

## Overview
This project involves the development of a machine learning (ML) model for modulation classification using MATLAB. The goal is to accurately identify the type of modulation of incoming signals, such as those detected by radar systems. By generating various modulated waves and training an ML model on this data, the project aims to achieve high accuracy in classifying unknown signals based on their modulation type.

## Objectives
1. **Generate Modulated Signals:** Create a dataset of various types of modulated waves, including but not limited to:
   - Binary Phase Shift Keying (BPSK)
   - Quadrature Phase Shift Keying (QPSK)
   - Amplitude Modulation (AM)
   - Frequency Modulation (FM)
   - Quadrature Amplitude Modulation (QAM)
   - Phase Shift Keying (PSK)

2. **Feature Extraction:** Extract relevant features from the generated modulated signals to be used in training the ML model.

3. **Model Training:** Train a machine learning model using the extracted features. Suitable models may include:
   - Support Vector Machines (SVM)
   - Decision Trees
   - Neural Networks
   - Ensemble Methods

4. **Model Evaluation:** Evaluate the performance of the trained model using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to ensure robust classification.

5. **Prediction of Unknown Signals:** Use the trained model to classify unknown incoming signals based on their modulation type.

## Methodology
1. **Data Generation:**
   - Use MATLAB to generate a comprehensive dataset of modulated signals. Each signal type (BPSK, QPSK, etc.) is generated with varying parameters to ensure diversity in the training data.

2. **Feature Extraction:**
   - Implement signal processing techniques to extract features such as amplitude, phase, frequency, and higher-order statistics from the modulated signals.

3. **Model Training:**
   - Split the dataset into training and testing sets.
   - Use MATLABâ€™s machine learning toolbox to train various models on the training set.
   - Optimize model parameters using techniques such as cross-validation.

4. **Model Evaluation:**
   - Assess model performance on the testing set.
   - Use confusion matrices and classification reports to analyze the results.

5. **Prediction:**
   - Implement the trained model to classify real-time incoming signals captured by radar.
   - Provide a user-friendly interface in MATLAB for visualizing the classification results.

## Tools and Technologies
- **MATLAB:** Used for data generation, feature extraction, model training, evaluation, and real-time prediction.
